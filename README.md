## About Project

This project was for my computer networking class that allowed us to choose any networking topic.
I decided to make an app the got data from an API, specefically the Kitsu API(JSON).

A few resources needed to understand the code are labeled below:

- [Kitsu API: Understand how the API calls are made](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/)
- [Shared Preferences: Learn how to store certain information in app](https://medium.com/flutterdevs/using-sharedpreferences-in-flutter-251755f07127)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
